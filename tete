Turkey Visa Cover Letter
I wrote a cover letter for Turkey tourist visa explaining the reason I wanted to travel to Turkey, the places I wanted to visit, the date of arrival and the date I planned to leave. I also mentioned that I was traveling with my wife.

Original Leave Letter
You need to submit a leave letter

from your employer if you are employed. This should have the company seal and signature. They are very strict about this.
on a personal business letter head if you are self-employed woth the company seal and signature.
In my case, I provided them with a leave letter from my employer for the duration of my visit.

Salary Slips
I submitted the payslips for the last 3 months as the employment proof.

If you are a freelancer, you can provide contract documents & leave/cover letter as applicable.

If you are retired, you need to provide the retirement documents & income proof (original or copies attested).
